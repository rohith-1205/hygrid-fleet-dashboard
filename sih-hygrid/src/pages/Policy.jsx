      <h2>Policy and Regulations for Hydrogen-EV Hybrid Mobility</h2>
      <p>
        The adoption of <b>Hydrogen-EV Hybrid vehicles</b> requires clear
        guidelines, safety standards, and incentives. Below are the major
        considerations for India’s clean mobility roadmap.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>1. Green Hydrogen Standards</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Hydrogen used in vehicles must be produced from <b>renewable
            sources</b> such as solar or wind-powered electrolysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) mandates certification
            of “Green Hydrogen” for transport use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pressure and purity standards to be maintained (≥ 99.97% purity).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>2. Safety Regulations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Type-IV composite canisters for swappable hydrogen storage.</li>
          <li>
            Refueling stations must follow <b>350 bar</b> and <b>700 bar</b>{" "}
            international safety norms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vehicles must integrate <b>real-time leak detection sensors</b> and
            pressure control valves.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>3. Hybrid Vehicle Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Dual power source (Hydrogen + Battery) for optimized energy
            consumption.
          </li>
          <li>
            At low speeds (&lt;30 km/h), <b>battery priority</b> to reduce
            hydrogen wastage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Above 30 km/h, <b>hydrogen fuel cell</b> takes over for high-speed
            efficiency.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>4. Infrastructure & Deployment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Establish dedicated <b>hydrogen refueling corridors</b> along
            highways.
          </li>
          <li>
            Urban clusters to deploy <b>hydrogen swap stations</b> alongside EV
            charging stations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Public–Private Partnership (PPP) models for scaling infrastructure.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>5. Incentives & Policy Support</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Subsidies for vehicle buyers under <b>FAME-III</b> (Faster Adoption
            and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles).
          </li>
          <li>
            Lower GST rates on hydrogen and hybrid components (currently 5% for
            EVs).
          </li>
          <li>
            Carbon credits for fleet operators adopting hydrogen-EV hybrids.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>6. Environmental Benefits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Zero tailpipe CO₂ emissions when using green hydrogen.</li>
          <li>
            Potential to reduce India’s transport emissions by{" "}
            <b>40–50% by 2035</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hydrogen produced from renewables aligns with{" "}
            <b>National Green Hydrogen Mission (2023)</b>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>7. Future Outlook</h3>
        <p>
          The integration of Hydrogen-EV hybrid systems is expected to{" "}
          <b>revolutionize rural, urban, and industrial transport</b>. With
          policy support, scalable infrastructure, and AI-enabled fleet
          management, India can become a <b>global leader</b> in clean mobility.
