# 🌱 HyGrid – AI-Enabled Hydrogen-EV Hybrid Mobility Dashboard  

### Smart India Hackathon 2025 – Renewable / Sustainable Energy & Clean Mobility  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  
India’s transport sector is rapidly exploring **green hydrogen mobility** as part of the National Hydrogen Mission. However, adoption is limited due to:  
- Insufficient hydrogen refueling stations  
- High storage & logistics costs  
- Limited public/industry awareness  
- Lack of real-time fleet monitoring tools  

**Our solution:**  
A **Hydrogen-EV Hybrid Management Platform** that demonstrates the working of **hybrid vehicles (battery + hydrogen canisters)**, simulates **energy usage in real-time**, and provides **insights for drivers, fleet operators, and policymakers**.

## 🚗 Our Solution – HyGrid  
We propose a **hybrid mobility model** where:  
- Vehicles use **Type-IV swappable hydrogen canisters** (5 kg = 625 km range).  
- An additional **battery pack provides 250 km range**.  
- Vehicle dynamically switches:  
  - 🔋 **Battery** → Low-speed driving (<30 km/h)  
  - 🟢 **Hydrogen fuel cell** → High-speed driving (>=30 km/h)  
- AI-enabled dashboard simulates:  
  - Speed, distance traveled, remaining range  
  - Energy flow visualization (Battery ↔ Hydrogen → Motor → Wheels)  
  - Low-range alerts & nearest refueling stations  
  - Cost of hydrogen refills (₹450/kg)

## ✨ Features  
- **Driver Dashboard** with speedometer & odometer  
- **Hybrid power management** (automatic switch between battery & hydrogen)  
- **Real-time simulation** of fuel/battery consumption  
- **Energy flow animation** for better understanding  
- **Hydrogen refill & cost tracking**  
- **Low range alerts** (≤20 km) with nearest station info  
- **Policy & Infrastructure insights page**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React.js + Vite  
- **Styling**: CSS / Tailwind-inspired custom styles  
- **Maps**: Leaflet (for hydrogen station locations)  
- **Version Control**: GitHub
